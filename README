This is Bressein, a fetion client written in Qt framework, analogous to Openfetion, developed on GNU/Linux.

Openfetion (see https://ofetion.googlecode.com/hg/ for detail) is a GTK based fetion client.
Bressein is inspired by Levin's Openfetion, but completely written in Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/).

Bressein is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

We host repository on gitorious.org and github.com:
    https://gitorious.org/bressein/bressein
    https://github.com/lyarbean/Bressein

If you would like to improve this software or have any suggestion,
please contact 颜烈彬(Lyarbean) <slbyan@gmail.com>!

Additionally we provide commercial technical support if you need.

Status: this project is under refactoring, and many features that openfetion has
haven't been implemented.
