This is Bressein, a fetion client, written in Qt framework, inspired by Openfetion.
Openfetion (see https://ofetion.googlecode.com/hg/ for detail) is a GTK based
fetion client. Our work starts inspired by Levin's Openfetion, and we rewrite sipc
in Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/).

Bressein is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
Additionally we provide Bressein under the terms of a commercial licensing
agreement for the development of proprietary and/or commercial software and
 technical support.

We host repository on gitorious.org and github.com:
    https://gitorious.org/bressein/bressein
    https://github.com/lyarbean/Bressein

If you would like to improve this software or have any suggestion,
please contact Lyarbean <slbyan@gmail.com>!



Status: this project is under refactoring, and many features that openfetion has
haven't been implemented.
