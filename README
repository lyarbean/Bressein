This is Bressein, a fetion client, written in Qt framework, inspired by Openfetion.
Openfetion (see https://ofetion.googlecode.com/hg/ for detail) is a GTK based
fetion client. Our work starts from Openfetion's libofetion, and we rewrite sipc
in Qt (http://qt.nokia.com/).

Bressein is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

We host repository on gitorious.org and github.com:
    https://gitorious.org/bressein/bressein
    https://github.com/lyarbean/Bressein

If you would like to improve this software or have any suggestion,
please contact me!

So far, this project is under refactoring, and many features that openfetion has
haven't been implemented.
