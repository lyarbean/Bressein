Using Graphics View Framework

Main Panel has a List-View, showing its items via QGraphicsItem subclassing, and
a QGraphicsScene per se;


Design:
    The item has a key siPuri which get from data.
    To initialize a scene, let scene use the data to generate items via a item
    factory. When data changed, for each item, assign new datum, and if amount
    of data is increased, generate more to fit it else if decreased, that is
    some items'datum are removed, the 'remove' them. Then the item is activated,
    a signal with the key pos will be emitted and find the datum via the data
    and then call User to start a chat session by pass the datum.
