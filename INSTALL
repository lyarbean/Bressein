Requirements:
Qt (http://qt.nokia.com), version 4.7.0+ as recommended.
OpenSsl(http://www.openssl.org/).
CMake version 2.6.0 at least.

So far we just support for GNU/Linux and BSD's;
I didn't experience programming on windows, please get help from others if
you need.

Get source:
git clone  git://github.com/lyarbean/Bressein.git Bressein
# or
git clone git://gitorious.org/bressein/bressein.git Bressein

building:
cd Bressein && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

I'm sorry that I haven't had added install step in CMakeLists.txt, though I will do soon.
